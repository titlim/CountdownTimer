To create a countdown timer using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, start by defining the duration of the countdown and setting up the basic HTML structure to display the timer. Use HTML to create placeholders for days, hours, minutes, and seconds. Style these placeholders with CSS to make the timer visually appealing and easy to read. Implement the countdown logic in JavaScript by calculating the time remaining until the target date and updating the display in real-time. Finally, decide how the timer should behave when it reaches zero, such as showing a notification or triggering a specific action. This combination of technologies will result in a functional and engaging countdown timer for your website.
